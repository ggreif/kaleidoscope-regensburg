* Finally-tagless representation

Let's consider the "finally" thingy first.

represent AST nodes with functions alone

our expression is "(3 + 4^2) * 2"

> -- {-
> plus, times, power :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer
> (plus, times, power) = ((+), (*), (**))

Constants are just themselves (for now)

Now manually transcribe our expression

> expr = (3 `plus` (4 `power` 2)) `times` 2

clearly we can just ask GHCi for the result:

*Main> expr
38

We can think of our AST being encoded by functions and the "evaluator"
just the identity:

> interpr'Integer = id

A very strange interpreter!
